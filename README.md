# Typescript Web Development Interview

## Overview

Welcome to the Hex Web Development Interview! During the interview session, you'll use this boilerplate repository to build out a frontend application with your interviewer. Before the session starts, please clone this repository and run `yarn` in the root to install dependencies. You can also add any other dependencies that you think that you may want to use, but there is no need to write any code or do anything else ahead of time to prepare for the session.

## Running the app

1) First, install dependencies with `yarn`.
2) Run `yarn start`. You should be able to view the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). It will hot reload as you make changes.
